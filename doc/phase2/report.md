##Initial Planning
Definition of our Scrum Master:
* Scheduling update meetings.
* Maintain github issue database (sprint backlog).
* Resolve team conflicts and scheduling issues.
* Designate roles and assign tasks to front-end, back-end teams.

We will rotate scrum master every phase for those who would like to do it, so far we have Rathusshan and Allahverdi.
Our scrum master will not designate help, because he may not have the most technical knowledge in a certain area.
This is why our team of six is split into two, having a team of 3 to work on the front-end and vice-versa for the back end. 
We chose this approach so we have leaders for both teams (front-end: Allahverdi and back-end: Denis)
that are technically experienced in those areas, and have a better idea of how to estimate task sizes and designate help.
Therefore these front-end, back-end leaders can inform the scrum master on how front-end/back-end tasks to be changed and what issues
they are having.

Estimating Task Size:

We will label each github issue (task in sprint backlog) as Small(S), Medium(M) or Large(L).
* S - Task that requires 1-2 hours of coding/testing.
* M - Task that requires 3-6 hours of coding.
* L - Task that will span a day or multiple days, with sitdown meetings needed for design decisions.


##Sprint Backlog
What we are building:
a web app using HTML/CSS/Javascript (front-end), PHP, SQL for backend.
With our chosen user stories below, we have focused on increasing classroom interaction by allowing for anonymity and ease of use
in asking questions.

Features:
* Mobile compatible
* Signup/Login system with room code.
* Each classroom with the app will have its own question/answer session for each lecture.
* A split-view for professors to see incoming questions and an area to ask the room a question.
* Rating system for all student questions, that students can upvote/downvote.
* A split-view for students to see student questions and to ask/answer prof question.
* Anonymity - Students see other students as anonymous, professor can still see student names/email's.
* Log of questions is kept after each lecture session.
* Professor can record response to the question while its being said, and stored in lecture session database (mp3 file).

Chosen user stories, centered around basic question/answer and anonymity.

1. As an average computer science student who struggles with public speaking, I want to be able to ask questions so that I can get the most out of my university education.
2. As a clueless, extroverted student I want to ask a low - level question while being anonymous so that I can catch up to the material without the implicit shame of stupidity.
3. As an instructor I want to encourage all members of the class to have an equal opportunity to ask questions so that each student feels like they understand the material.

**Phase 2 Sprint Backlog**

Front-end:
* Overall design decision (S)
* Login page (S) 
* Lecture session selection view (S)
* Answering/Asking questions view (M)
* Differentiate the views between student and prof (M)

Back-end:
* Simple sign up/login system (S)
* Student prof asking/answering question
* Keeping logs of questions per lecture
* Prof will be able to “create lecture sessions”
* Students will be able to “log into lecture sessions”
* Ability to join the class
* Question/Answer text areas

Both:
* Front-end/Back-end leaders final merge between front-end and back-end.
