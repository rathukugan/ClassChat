##Process
All the members of our team worked very well together. During our first meeting, we discussed very clearly on how to establish an open, non-hostile environment. For instance, we emphasized the importance of communication skills among the group. Not only should individuals express their ideas without having to feel threatened, listening carefully to others matter as well. We felt that it was one of the most essential topics to discuss because it will definitely set a tone to the rest of the semester. 


To organize the team, we made a Facebook group chat where everyone can communicate freely. Any concerns, quick questions, or ideas are posted here for others to view and discuss. Although it is difficult to meet up, we managed to meet at least twice a week. This is the time when we come together to make the 'big' decisions on certain aspects of the project. We felt that it makes communication a lot easier when talking face-to-face. Often, it becomes challenging to get everyone to agree on a final decision. Thus, each group member would show great attention to all the ideas while respectfully challenging them. This creates a sense of mutual trust as we shared our ideas and feelings truthfully. 


In terms of work distribution, we split the work fairly among all five of us. Since Phase 1 is pure writing, we opened up a Google Doc where we can put all our work safely in one place. To set up an effective group process, we all agreed on what needs to be done, by whom, and by when. Consequently, individuals could be held accountable and can also hold others accountable for their tasks. Lastly, we would come together one last time to give each other constructive feedback. We would focus on ideas and behaviours rather than individuals.


A lesson we would take forward to the next phase is to communicate more, both verbally and through online messages. At times, most of the members weren't very aware of the status of each other's distributed work. Thus, it was difficult as a group to agree to move on to the next stage.
