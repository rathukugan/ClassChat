###Objective
Improve student-professor interaction during class time and help the professor to be more personal with students. This will be achieved by creating a responsive web app that will be used during the class time by professor and students to ask or answer questions. The application will encourage interaction by giving an option to students to answer in-class questions and ask questions (anonymous to fellow students) without feeling social pressure.

###Personas

*Key Persona 1:* Sarah - a computer-science student who recently transferred from another school. She enjoys reading fiction and listening to music in her spare time between classes and finds it hard to start conversations.

*Key Persona 2:* Josh - 21 year old student studying Physics at University of Toronto maintaining 3.8 GPA. He is respected among his peers for his personality, work ethics and intelligence.

*Key Persona 3:* Matthew - A recently hired professor who worked in the industry for decades. He has immense knowledge of the subject and strives to learn every day

###Scenarios

*Key Scenario 1:* Sarah is struggling with her computer science material and does not have the confidence to ask a question that she desperately wants the answer to. She waits for somebody to ask her question, but nobody is willing to.

*Key Scenario 2:* Josh spent the better part of the weekend researching class-material on the internet to pursue his interest. He refuses to ask a question regarding the concept professor went over in class, because of his pride in self-learning.

*Key Scenario 3:* Matthew actively enjoys teaching and helping other people learn. Judging from the blank faces, Matthew canâ€™t tell if he is going too fast or too slow. He struggles to find an optimal way for students to actively ask questions so he can gauge student understanding.


###Principles

*Key Principle 1:* An equal opportunity to learn should be offered to all students regardless of their personality. Interaction between professor and student is a critical part of the learning experience. Thus, questions should be actively sought out for in any form possible.

*Key Principle 2:* The professor lecturing should always account for student understanding. Judging from the type and frequency of the questions asked, the professor can correctly gauge what concepts need to be explained further and can correctly. This application should be able to be used as a tool to improve teaching proficiency.
