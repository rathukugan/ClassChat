###Objective
Improve student-professor interaction during class time and help professor to be more personal with students by giving an option to students to answer in-class question and ask questions without feeling social pressure from the peers. This will be achieved by creating a web app (compatible with mobile phones as well) that will be used during the class time by professor (to receive the questions and answers to his/her own questions) and students (for answering the questions or asking questions). Generally, every student will be able to log in with their own account, thus professor will be able to know whom he is interacting with. Additionally, the professor will have an option whether to show the questions on the projector, show the name of the user in public and etc.

###Personas
**Key Persona 1:** Sarah - a computer-science student who recently transferred from another school. She enjoys reading fiction and listening to music in her spare time between classes and finds it hard to start conversations.

**Key Persona 2:** Josh - 21 year old student studying Physics at University of Toronto maintaining 3.8 GPA. He is respected among his peers for his personality, work ethics and intelligence.

**Key Persona 3:** Matthew - A recently hired professor who worked in the industry for decades. He has immense knowledge of the subject and strives to learn every day.

###Scenarios
**Key Scenario 1:** Sarah has been busy all week because of her family’s dog being put down. Emotionally, she is not all that there. She is a shadow of a human, and is struggling to find a will to live. Sarah is struggling with her computer science material and does not have the confidence nor the mental stability to ask a question that she desperately wants the answer to.

**Key Scenario 2:** Josh really likes computer science. He just spent the better part of the weekend researching class-material on the internet to pursue his interest. During lecture, he has a unique thought that would improve the function being explained. He wants to ask if his idea is valid, but doesn’t want to speak up and be “that guy” who asks a question nobody understands. 

**Key Scenario 3:** Matthew actively enjoys teaching and helping other people learn. On his daily commute to school, he whispers computer science secrets to anyone willing to listen to spread the joy that is knowledge. Matthew wants everyone in his lecture to enjoy his passion as much as he does. Judging from the blank faces, Matthew can’t tell if he is going too fast or too slow. He needs a way for students to actively ask questions.

###Principles
**Key Principle 1:** An equal opportunity to learn should be offered to all students regardless of their personality. Interaction between professor and student is a critical part of the learning experience. Thus, questions should be actively sought out for in any form possible.

**Key Principle 2:** The professor lecturing should always account for student understanding. Judging from the type and frequency of the questions asked, the professor can correctly gauge what concepts need to be explained further and can correctly. This application should be able to be used as a tool to improve teaching proficiency.
