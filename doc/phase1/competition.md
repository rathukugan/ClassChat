Summary
- An online assessment tool for the classroom, that allows the teacher to create a pre-prepared quiz for students or conduct live quick questions, including multiple choice, true/false and short answer. 
- Students can use the web or iOS/Android and can join by room code, where teachers can see responses in real time.

How is our product different?
- Our product also supports students answering questions.
- However, our product puts a bigger focus on allowing students (potentially anonymous) to ask questions to the professor, with a rating system the class can use to agree on the best ones to ask.

Comparisons in users between products
- Socrative is targeted to teachers who can bond with their small classrooms using the app.
- Our product is better for: college/university students who are in large lectures with a single professor.

Why doesnt Socrative focus on these users?
- Competitors donâ€™t focus on these users because it is easier for grade school classrooms to adapt to this technology.
- Difference being that teachers must provide incentive for kids to learn, in university students pay money to learn.
- University students dont get the interactive satisfaction from question/answer apps due to IClicker.
- Raising hands in a large lecture hall doesnt result in the best questions answered.
- Professors would have to adapt to more question/answer periods and this change is something that competitors may feel is too tough of a scenario to break through. 
- It would likely take a new generation of professors who understand the undergraduate experience, who would be willing to use technology to help enhance it.

Summary
- An app that provides an easy way for teachers to encourage students and share their moments with parents.
- This app is in the same teacher/student interactivity problem space as our product.

How is our product different?
- ClassDojo uses encouragement from teachers/parents to increase interactivity.
- Our product has an emphasis on the question/answer aspect of the classroom.

Comparisons in users/scenarios between products
- ClassDojo is targeted to students under 10, and uses app encouragement to ask more questions.
- Our product is for: college/university students who need anonymity and a rating system for the best questions to get asked.

Why doesnt ClassDojo focus on these users?
- Parents dont have as much influence over students in university.
- If TA's, tutors and other mentors could be connected to the app, students can plan how to improve in the classroom by asking questions.
- It would take much smaller class sizes and more hands-on TA's for ClassDojo to provide a solution to the university scenario.
