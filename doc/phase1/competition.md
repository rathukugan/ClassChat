Summary
- An online assessment tool for the classroom, that allows the teacher to create a pre-prepared quiz for students or conduct live quick questions, including multiple choice, true/false and short answer. 
- Students can use the web or iOS/Android and can join by room code, where teachers can see responses in real time.

How is our product different?
- Our product also support students answering questions.
- However, our product puts a bigger focus on allowing students (potentially anonymous) to ask questions to the professor, with a rating system the class can use to agree on the best ones to ask.

Comparisons in users between products
- Socrative feels more generated to grade school style learning, as teachers can bond with their small classrooms using the app.
- Our product is better for: college/university students who are in large lectures with a single professor.

Why doesnt Socrative focus on these users?
- Competitors donâ€™t focus on these users because it is easier for grade school classrooms to adapt to this technology
- Difference being that teachers must provide incentive for kids to learn, in university students pay money to learn.
- University students dont get the interactive satisfaction from question/answer apps due to IClicker.
- Raising hands dont result in the best questions answered, with the large amount of students.
- Professors would have to adapt to more question/answer periods and this change is something that competitors may feel is too tough of a scenario to break through. 
- It would likely take a new generation of professors who understand the undergraduate student, and would be willing to use technology to help enhance it.
