Cancelled from our original planning
* [~~Displaying logs of questions per lecture~~](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team8-L5101/issues/26)
 * Removed after update meeting 1, details beind a confusion indicator can be too annoying to deal with + ambigious.
* ~~Prof recording voice answers~~
 * Technically challenging to do for this project time wise.
 * Takes away from the point of our app, we want the prof to easily transition to answer a question the student asks through the app.
* Mobile compatible
 * Not cancelled per say, but was already done by phase 2 since bootstrap makes it work well with mobile already.
